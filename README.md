The exercises are submitted via GitHub, and by marking the exercises as done in the "my submissions" tab of the submission system.

You can submit all of the exercises into the same repository, or use multiple different repositories. If you submit exercises from different parts into the same repository, name your directories well. If you use a private repository to submit the exercises, add mluukkai as a collaborator to it.

One good way to name the directories in your submission repository is as follows:

part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  courseinfo
  phonebook
  countriescopy
So, each part has its own directory, which contains a directory for each exercise set (like the unicafe exercises in part 1).
